# ckb-contract-toolchains

A customized Rust toolchain for building CKB smart contracts. Some of the highlights are:

* RISC-V B extension is enabled by default
* An accompanying GNU toolchain is provided for now to build C code
* A new Rust target `riscv64imac_zba_zbb_zbc_zbs-unknown-ckb-elf` enables `std` in Rust
* Other useful optimizations for CKB

Notice all the changes made here are optimizations. CKB-VM still strictly obeys RISC-V specification, which means the official Rust toolchain / GNU toolchain can still be used to build CKB smart contracts.

## Usage

Right now `ckb-contract-toolchains` only supports Ubuntu 22.04 running on x86_64 architecture.

In case you are on a bare minimal environment(such as the official jammy docker image), a few basic dependencies are required:

```bash
$ sudo apt-get install lsb-release
```

[rustup](https://rustup.rs/) is also needed here, please refer to rustup's installation steps.

Now use the following command to install the toolchain:

```bash
$ curl -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xxuejie/ckb-contract-toolchains/main/install.sh | bash
```

When succeeded, the final message generated by the installation script will show the new Rust toolchain version installed.

You can also manually list all installed toolchains:

```
$ rustup toolchain list
```

All toolchains provided by this repo starts with `ckb`.
